## ðŸŒ¿ Overview
This project explores how dam structures influence the Specific Leaf Area (SLA) of **Russian olive trees** (*Elaeagnus angustifolia*) in Colorado riparian ecosystems. The goal was to determine if trees located upstream of a dam exhibit different SLA values compared to those downstream, helping understand how water stress caused by dams affects invasive plant species.

## ðŸ”¬ Research Question
**Is the SLA of Russian olive trees higher upstream or downstream of dams?**

- **Hypothesis**: Dams limit water resources downstream, stressing trees and reducing SLA.
- **Prediction**: Trees upstream of dams will have higher SLA values compared to those downstream.

## ðŸ“ˆ Methods
- **Data Collection**:
  - Sampled **1020 Russian olive leaves** from seven sites across Colorado.
  - Leaves collected from top and mid canopy regions most exposed to sunlight.
  - Measurements taken: Fresh mass, leaf area (via area meter), and dry mass.

- **Data Analysis**:
  - Performed a **mixed model ANOVA**.
  - Leaf nested within tree as a random variable.
  - Location (upstream vs downstream) as the fixed effect.
  - Dependent variable: SLA (Specific Leaf Area).

## ðŸŒŽ Background
- **Russian olive trees** are non-native and invasive across riparian zones in the Western U.S.
- **Specific Leaf Area (SLA)** is a critical plant trait linked to growth rates and fitness.
- **Dams** alter hydrology, often stressing downstream vegetation by lowering groundwater availability (Schmutz & Moog, 2018).

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings
- The mixed model ANOVA found a **significant difference** between upstream and downstream sites (p < 0.0008).
- **Upstream trees** had higher SLA values (mean = **154.8**) compared to **downstream trees** (mean = **142.6**).
- This suggests **greater water stress** in downstream locations due to damming effects.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why It Matters
Understanding how dams influence plant physiological traits helps predict invasive species spread and informs riparian ecosystem management strategies. Insights from this study could lead to improved conservation efforts and ecological restoration planning.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Field data collection (mass and area measurement)
- Statistical modeling: Mixed model ANOVA ( using JMP )
- Data interpretation and scientific poster presentation

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements
- Expand study to multiple years and additional riparian sites.
- Incorporate soil moisture and water table depth measurements.
- Reanalyze data using Python (pandas, matplotlib, statsmodels) to automate statistical analysis.
